# web-dev-starter

This is a starter project for web development, we made a simple HTML and CSS
website here demonstrating the power of flex box and how to arrange elements in HTML
using CSS.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Testing

Tests and JS were removed, as this is a purely HTML + CSS project.
